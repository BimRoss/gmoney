# **G Money Yield Protocol: Sustainable USDC Staking with Protocol-Owned Liquidity**

## **Abstract**

The **G Money Yield Protocol** is an innovative **staking and yield-generating** DeFi application built on **Sonic blockchain**, utilizing a **two-token system** to balance long-term sustainability, external liquidity revenue, and user incentives.

At its core, the protocol allows users to **stake USDC and earn daily rewards**, while leveraging **Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)** and a **deflationary reward token (G Money) to ensure sustainability**.

By using **USDC as the foundation**, the protocol provides long-term confidence while offering **compoundable daily earnings**. The introduction of a **Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)-based minting mechanism** ensures a **secure, manipulation-resistant issuance process** for G Money.

The protocol is designed to prevent hyperinflation while maximizing capital efficiency through **concentrated liquidity management (YieldIQ via SwapX)**, external revenue from **liquidity fees**, and an **automated burn mechanism**.

## **1. Core Mechanics**

### **1.1 USDC Staking & Daily Yield**

- Users **stake USDC**, which is **permanently locked** in the protocol.
- They earn **1% daily in USDC**, withdrawable or compoundable.
- Users who **hold G Money** in their wallet receive **increased yields** based on the following multiplier table:

| **G Money Held (% of Deposited USDC)** | **Daily ROI (%)** |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0%                                     | 1.00%             |
| 25%                                    | 1.25%             |
| 50%                                    | 1.50%             |
| 75%                                    | 1.75%             |
| 100%                                   | 2.00% (Max)       |

- When a user **claims rewards**, their **staked amount is reduced by the same amount**, ensuring fair compounding mechanics.

### **1.2 TWAP-Based G Money Minting**

- G Money is **minted dynamically based on its TWAP price** to ensure fair issuance and prevent price manipulation.
- **Process for minting G Money when a user deposits USDC into the staking contract:**

  1. **User deposits USDC** into the staking contract.
  2. The contract **queries the SwapX TWAP oracle** to determine the **average market price** of G Money over a set timeframe (e.g., last 30 minutes).
  3. The protocol **mints G Money equivalent to the TWAP price**, ensuring the user receives a fair amount based on recent market conditions.
  4. The **minted G Money + deposited USDC is added to the protocolâ€™s POL**, ensuring deep liquidity and supporting trading activity.

- **Why TWAP is necessary:**
  âœ… **Prevents price manipulation** â†’ Avoids single-block flash loan exploits or sandwich attacks.  
  âœ… **Ensures fair issuance** â†’ Users mint based on the **real market price**, not a fixed or exploitable ratio.  
  âœ… **Maintains liquidity balance** â†’ Keeps the USDC/G Money pool properly weighted as new deposits enter the system.

## **2. Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) & Revenue Generation**

### **2.1 POL & Liquidity Mechanics**

- The **YieldIQ vault allows for single-sided deposits**, meaning G Money can be **added first** while USDC enters over time as users trade.
- POL is **managed by SwapXâ€™s YieldIQ vault**, optimizing **concentrated liquidity in the G Money/USDC pool**.
- The **YieldIQ vault autonomously rebalances liquidity**, ensuring price stability and maximizing fee capture.

### **2.2 Fee Utilization**

- Trading fees from the POL are collected in both **USDC & G Money**.
- **G Money trading fees are burned**, while **USDC fees are sent to the treasury** to fund daily yield payouts.
- This **dual mechanism ensures deflationary pressure on G Money while supporting long-term payouts**.

---

## **3. Treasury & Sustainability**

### **3.1 Treasury Reserve (USDC)**

- **50% of the presale USDC funds** go directly to the treasury to seed initial payouts.
- **Ongoing USDC earnings from POL fees** continuously replenish the treasury.
- If the treasury balance runs low, **G Money is minted and sold into POL** to generate additional USDC.

### **3.2 G Money Supply & Burn Mechanism**

- **Initial supply of G Money:** 100,000 tokens (sold in presale at $1 per token).
- G Money is **only minted in two scenarios**:
  1. **A user deposits USDC into staking** â†’ TWAP-based G Money minting to ensure fair issuance.
  2. **Treasury runs low** â†’ G Money is **minted and sold into POL** to restore USDC reserves.
- **G Money fees earned in POL are burned**, reducing circulating supply and supporting price appreciation.

## **4. Market Stability & Anti-Manipulation Measures**

### **4.1 Preventing Large Sell-Offs & Slippage**

- **Deep liquidity & concentrated liquidity range** prevents excessive slippage.
- **TWAP-based minting ensures price stability** and prevents **flash-loan-based manipulation**.
- **Orbs Liquidity Hub (SwapX)** prevents sandwich attacks by using off-chain order matching instead of public mempool execution.
- **Dynamic rebalancing by YieldIQ** absorbs selling pressure by optimizing LP range positioning.
- **G Money supply is controlled** via the burn mechanism, reducing inflationary pressure.

## **5. Roadmap & Future Features**

### **Phase 1: Launch & Core Mechanics**

- âœ… Presale of **100,000 G Money @ $1 per token** to fund initial treasury & liquidity.
- âœ… **Deploy YieldIQ vault** for G Money/USDC concentrated liquidity.
- âœ… **Enable staking contract** with TWAP-based G Money minting.

### **Phase 2: Treasury & Liquidity Expansion**

- ðŸ”œ **Governance vault for strategic fund deployment**.
- ðŸ”œ **LP incentives** to further deepen liquidity.
- ðŸ”œ **Lending feature** â€“ Borrow **GUSD (a stablecoin) against G Money**, similar to Liquity's zero-interest loans.

### **Phase 3: Ecosystem Growth**

- ðŸ”œ **Cross-chain expansion** to other EVM chains.
- ðŸ”œ **Institutional partnerships** for treasury management & additional yield strategies.
- ðŸ”œ **Layered yield strategies**, incorporating real-world asset yields.

Users benefit from:
âœ… **Stable daily USDC earnings**  
âœ… **Compounding opportunities**  
âœ… **A deflationary reward token**  
âœ… **Deep liquidity & MEV-resistant trading**
